# Inducing Decision Trees

Implement and test the decision tree learning algorithm.

 - Download the two datasets available on myCourses. Each data set is divided into three sets: the training set, the validation set and the test set. Data sets are in CSV format. The first line in the file gives the attribute names. Each line after that is a training (or test) example that contains a list of attribute values separated by a comma. The last attribute is the class-variable. Assume that all attributes take values from the domain (0,1).
